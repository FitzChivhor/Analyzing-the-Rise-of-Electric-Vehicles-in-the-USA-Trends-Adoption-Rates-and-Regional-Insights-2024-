Project Title: Analyzing the Rise of Electric Vehicles in the USA: Trends, Adoption Rates, and Regional Insights (2024)

Overview:
This repository contains the data analysis project focused on the electric vehicle (EV) market in the United States as of 2024. The project aims to identify trends in EV adoption, evaluate regional disparities, and assess the growth of electric versus non-electric vehicles over time.

Key Objectives:

Trend Analysis: Examine how the popularity and adoption of electric vehicles have evolved from historical data.
Geographical Analysis: Investigate which states lead in EV adoption and how various states compare in terms of electric vehicle market penetration.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Perform essential preprocessing steps to ensure data quality, including handling missing values and correcting data types.
Feature Engineering: Develop new features to better understand the dynamics of EV adoption and facilitate more detailed analysis.
Hypothesis Testing: Validate the hypothesis that the proportion of electric vehicles has significantly increased over the years through statistical testing.
Methodology:
The analysis employs a variety of data manipulation techniques and visualizations to explore the electric vehicle dataset. Key methods include data aggregation, feature creation, and linear regression for hypothesis testing.

Results:
Findings indicate a significant increase in the adoption of electric vehicles, with certain states showing substantially higher adoption rates. The trend analysis demonstrates that electric vehicles are becoming a larger part of the automotive landscape in the USA.

Usage:
This dataset and accompanying Jupyter notebook are intended for researchers, policymakers, and business analysts who are interested in the electric vehicle market. The insights provided here can aid in decision-making related to environmental policy, automotive industry strategy, and infrastructure development.
